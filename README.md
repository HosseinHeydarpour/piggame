## My process
This project allowed me to harness the power of JavaScript and its DOM manipulation capabilities to create an engaging game. I employed techniques like querySelector, event listeners, and the DRY principle, which significantly enhanced my understanding of JavaScript.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript


### What I learned
In this mini project i really focused on my JS skills and tried to undrestand and learn new thing in JS

### Continued development
I still want to improve and enhace my abilities JS.
